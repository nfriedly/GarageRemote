# GarageRemote
Arduino-powered web app for remote controlling a, garage door. Also reports if you left the lights on.

Built with an Arduino Mega 2560, but could be trivially modified to work on an Uno or other model. 

Online at [garage.nathananderin.com](http://garage.nathananderin.com/), but only accessible from within my home network.
